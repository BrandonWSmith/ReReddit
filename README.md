<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To start the app, run:

Once the app has started, a browser window should open automatically. If your browser does not open automatically, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

In the app, you can choose from a list of the top subreddits using the menu on the left side of the page or search for subreddits using the searchbar at the top right of the page. Once you have selected a subreddit you will see the most recent posts for that subreddit. You can view comments for a post by clicking the blue speech bubble icon in the bottom right corner of the post. You can also upvote or downvote a post using the blue arrow icons to the left side of the post's window.
